# **Fin-tech Churn Rate Analysis Project**
•	Conducted a data analysis project in Python for a fin-tech start-up. Analyzed customer churn rates during the Covid-19 Pandemic, including pre-processing, analysis, and data visualization.

•	Utilized multiple ML algorithms to implement a unified model to predict churn rate and offer advice for data collection to improve its quality.

•	Identified key variables impacting churn rate during, and provided business strategy advice, which resulted in a 5% decrease of churn rate.

•	Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, PCA.
